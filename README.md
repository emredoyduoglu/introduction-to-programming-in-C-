What is C++?

C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.

C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.

C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.

The language was updated 3 major times in 2011, 2014, and 2017 to C++11, C++14, and C++17.
Why Use C++

C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.

C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.

C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.

C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.

C++ is fun and easy to learn!

As C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa
Get Started

This tutorial will teach you the basics of C++.

It is not necessary to have any prior programming experience.

Unit Outcomes:

apply variables in C++ program development

analyze C++ assignments and apply its components in program development

apply basic C++ I/O operations with different data types

design C++ expressions using arithmetic operations (including understanding their limitations, such as integer truncation, 
round-off error, division by zero, narrowing and widening conversions, casting, precedence, and standard math library functions)

design C++ expressions using relational operators (including understanding floating point equality)

design C++ expressions using logical operators (including short-circuit)

design C++ selection statements (including nested selection)

design C++ repetition statements (including count-controlled versus event-controlled, sentinel-controlled)
