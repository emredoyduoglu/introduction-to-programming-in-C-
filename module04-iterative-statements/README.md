<b><h1>Loops</h1></b>
Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.

Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.

<b><h2>While Loop</h2></b>
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true:

<span class="javakeywordcolor" style="color:mediumblue">while</span> (<em>condition</em>) {<br><span class="javanumbercolor" style="color:red">
</span>    <i>&nbsp; <span class="commentcolor" style="color:green">// code block to be executed</span></i><br></span><span class="javanumbercolor" style="color:red">
</span>
